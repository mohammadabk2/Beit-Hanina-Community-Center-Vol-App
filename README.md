# Volunteer Time Management App 

A web application designed for the Beit Hanina Community Center to efficiently manage event creation, approval, and volunteer coordination. Organizers can create events which admins can review and approve or reject. Volunteers can register for events, with registrations subject to approval or rejection by both admins and organizers. Admins have full control to create events, manage all activities, and oversee the entire system, ensuring smooth scheduling and participation tracking.
