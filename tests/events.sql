-- Section 2: Populating the 'events_status' table using IDs from 'events'
-- ---
-- We need to get the generated IDs first.
-- This part of the script is typically run after you've identified the IDs,
-- or dynamically in your application logic.
-- For a single script, you'd chain it with a CTE or multiple steps.

-- To make this a single runnable script, we'll assign IDs to statuses based on their position
-- This assumes the CTE 'inserted_events' orders IDs predictably, which it does based on insertion order.
-- In a real application, you'd fetch the IDs and then insert.
